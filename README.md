# ebrevet_card

An electronic brevet card for randonneuring.

## Introduction

This Android/iOS 
app serves as an automated brevet card that can provide Electronic Proof of Passage
on a randonneuring brevet, while maintaining some of the "feel" of the traditional paper brevet card process. 

## Features include

- Requires network access once to download event details. Afterward, can be used effectively without continous Cellular service or Internet access
- Monitors distance to controls and open/close times, and only allows control check in when appropriate
- Reports control check ins back to the region's web server to allow a real time rider progess page to be generated
- Can be used by any region with a small amount of server support for downloading event details
- Pre-ride mode allows for overriding control time/location check in rules, but results are marked as a pre-ride
