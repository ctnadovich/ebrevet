Privacy Notice

This privacy notice discloses the privacy practices for eBrevet cell phone app (the application). This privacy notice applies solely to information collected by this application. It will notify you of the following:

    What personally identifiable information is collected from you through the app, how it is used and with whom it may be shared.
    What choices are available to you regarding the use of your data.
    The security procedures in place to protect the misuse of your information.
    How you can correct any inaccuracies in the information.

Information Collection, Use, and Sharing

If you use the eBrevet app for electronic proof of passage (EPP) in a randonneuring event, the app will require your RUSA ID number. 

When using the App, as is required for EPP functionality, the app will monitor your 
location using the phone's GPS and will record your arrival at designated controls 
that are part of the event. This location information and control proximity detection
is the essense of the functionality of the application. 

In addition to your location and control proximity, the app will also record time
of day, app version number, and any configuration settings that are available. 

Should you use this application, your location and arrival information will be transmitted to the event organizers (specified by club name in the application settings) These organizers  become the sole owners of the information collected by the application. 

The event organizers may publish your location on a public website. They may use this information to monitor your progress around the course and in the case of emergency direct resources to you.  They will share your information with ACP and RUSA as required to homologate results and awards. Your contact info (personal and emergency) collected outside this application may be correlated with your RUSA number by the organizer, who will be shared with some event volunteers. Some of your information (your name, RUSA number, City, State, tracker URL, and ride results) may be posted publicly on various event rosters, event results, honor rolls, and results summaries.

For more details about how event organizers may use this data, refer to the privacy policies published by the organizers of the events with which you use this application. 


Your Access to and Control Over Information

If you don't want this application to track you during an event, use some other form of proof of passage, like a paper brevet card. Don't use this application. The purpose of this application is to track you as  part of your desire to use electronic proof of passage rather than traditional paper tracking. 

All the information collected by the application is visible on the application and can be deleted from your phone by uninstalling the application. Once your location is uploaded to the event organizers it is under their control. Please refer to the privacy policies published by the organizers of the events with which you use this application.
